I've been working with Python a lot lately, namely Django framework. It's been about a year and so far it has certainly been a pleasing experience and it fits my stack nicely. Focusing strictly on the front-end seems a bit overrated since the front-end in most of the cases does not work alone, but regularly communicates with the back-end. So from my point of view being comfortable with both front-end and back-end is a very useful skill for software developers.

Of course, during my freelancing career, I've been working with WordPress, which is PHP, but I can't say that is the path I'd like to take. NodeJS is far closer to me than PHP. But NodeJS seems to be a good fit for microservices and perhaps with NoSQL databases, so from that point of view Python has a bit different usage. I'd say that for complex back-ends it fits more and it plays well with SQL databases, as mentioned Django framework.

Python is now part of my professional portfolio, so if anyone's interested in that kind of development, you can reach out to me.
