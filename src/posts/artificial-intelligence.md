AI has been all over the place lately. I've too tried ChatGPT. It sure isn't perfect and I can't imagine I would let it write code for me. Maybe some simple part, but it definitely cannot handle the complexity I deal with on a daily basis. If I only recall autonomous driving cars... how long has that been? Many years ago and it still feels far from seeing those on the streets, or at least in the Czech Republic. AI still seems far from taking over any profession, but it sure can help people to be more efficient in their jobs. Anyway, AI looks very interesting and promising.

While some people fear losing their jobs, I'm convinced AI is the future and we should support it. Instead of being afraid of AI, maybe we will soon be able to enjoy the 4-day work week. I can imagine some professions that are not creative and involve doing some tedious work could be soon entirely replaced by AI. But that's what we want, right? Let's let people do what's difficult and creative and the simple boring work no one wants to do anyway can be automated by AI. What a future ahead.

Though I have to admit, I'm pretty concerned about the future students. When I think about the knowledge and writing abilities AI possesses already. Will university degrees be given out for free because nobody will be able to tell written papers from AI-generated papers? Will we raise generations of stupid students because everyone will just use AI bots instead of actually studying?
