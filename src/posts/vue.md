title: "Adding Vue.js to my CV"
---

A the end of 2021 I started at company Labster, which has brought an interesting challenge to me - develop web applications using popular library **vue.js**. I already have solid experience with **react** so I was keen to learn **vue.js** to gain new experience and perspective on Single Page App development.

Of course, both **react** and **vue.js** share many things. It's all JavaScript and concepts like components, state, events... are the same. The most noticeable difference is that **react** is a library while **vue.js** is a framework. So **vue.js** is more driving the course of the development and offers more features out of the box.

I do not want to dive into a comparison, they both have some advantages and disadvantages. To literary say "this one is better" would require a lot of thinking and consideration and it's difficult anyway because I'm not simply re-doing the same projects in **vue.js** that I've done in **react**. Nonetheless, **vue.js** is interesting and I'm glad I can add it to my professional CV.
