I always wanted to develop a browser extension, just to know how to do it, how it works. So this time during my self-studying I decided to create a Chrome extension. A colleague of mine once said a silly thing - he had many tabs opened in his web browser, it was clearly difficult for him to navigate, so he said that he could use some program to close those old tabs for him. And that's what I made - a simple extension that automatically closes tabs that have not been active for a specific period of time.

It's useful if you open some tabs and then you forget about them, do not care about them anymore, they just take up your space, so this extension will silently close them for you. You can find the extension on my GitHub [Tab terminator](https://github.com/alestrunda/tab-terminator).

Chrome has a pretty nice API to manage those browser things like storage, tabs, bookmarks... with great documentation. Since all you need is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it was quite simple for me to create the extension. Hence in case anyone's interested in developing something like that, let me know, I'm at your service.
