[Syntax.fm](http://syntax.fm/) is a podcast for web developers. Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, popular developers who make online courses, share their insights on news in web development and other areas developers might be interested in. I've been listening to it for quite some time now. I started listening only to those episodes I fond most interesting, but I've grown very found of this podcast and now listen to every single one. They publish two a week.

Episodes are not too long to bore, on the contrary they are pretty entertaining. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone who wants to fill his free time while commuting, working out, etc. with something meaningful and learn something. 

Keeping our knowledge up to date and constant learning, those are burdens that come with being a developer. Luckily this profession has also some perks to keep it in balance.
