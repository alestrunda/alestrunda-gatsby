Though so far almost all my clients were from Czech Republic I need also english version of my web sites. But it's tiresome to write everything in two languages, so I reached a decision to use just one language.

I write code in english, I read blogs in english, I watch educational videos in english, many local companies prefer or even require CV in english. Therefore I believe it's wise to have english as the one and only language. I hope I won't get any complaints, but this just makes sense and it also might bring me some new opportunities abroad.

My web sites were under .cz domain. But from now on they are not in czech at all, so I suppose it should not be under cz domain anymore, that's why I registered alestrunda.eu
