title: "Master your CSP header setup"
---

In December 2024, I had the opportunity to present at a front-end meetup in Prague ([link](https://www.meetup.com/outreach-prague-group/events/304755420/)). For the topic, I chose "Master Your CSP Header Setup" (CSP stands for Content Security Policy) because it was something I had recently worked on at SentinelOne. I had already prepared a tech talk on the subject for my team, so I had all the necessary information summarized.

The topic is highly technical and intended for software engineers. However, since I had enough time, I started with an introduction to CSP. I believe that even if someone wasn't familiar with the topic, they could quickly grasp the basics and learn something new. After the introduction, I discussed the CSP header in detail, covering the entire process—from setup to development, debugging, testing, and monitoring. I wrapped up the presentation with real-world examples and live coding, followed by a Q&A session.

The experience was fantastic. I met intelligent people, learned new things, and received positive feedback on both my performance and the topic. If anyone is interested, I’d be happy to give such technical presentations at other meetups.
