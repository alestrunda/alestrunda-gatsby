title: "My freelance availability"
---

Though I've been working as a full-time employee for several months now, I'm still available for freelance jobs, but of course, not that many hours as before when I was freelancing for full-time. I suppose 20 hours a week is the maximum I can spare. I spend those hours in the IT world anyway reading articles, watching video lessons, or working on my side projects.

So do not hesitate to reach out to me, I'll be glad to spend that time working on some real projects than trying to come up with a new idea for a side project. I like experimenting with new technologies, would be great if you're after something like that too and do not want just another WordPress website that I've made dozens of. Let's create something awesome.
