When I started with git, all the command line seems kind of a cumbersome. You need to define a lot of aliases for all those commands and sometimes you just forget that command anyway. You gonna need some basic tool that will at least show you what branch you're on, otherwise in a bigger repository when several colleagues, you'll eventually commit something somewhere you did not intend to. It indeed makes you wonder, there must be some better how to handle that, preferable with some handy UI.

There are several very nice alternatives to the CLI. At first, I used TortoiseGit, it's ok, mostly it does most of the things you gonna need and it's free. But when I started working in a company with more people in the team, I found out I could use something better. You've got two or even more branches where you're doing some development, then there is of course master, maybe some staging, etc. and you do some code reviews for other team members. You need to switch between all those branches easily and make sure you won't make a mess.

Then I discovered GitKraken. Great tool, I read about it in some survey, it's trendy. I started with the free version in a trial, and then I reached the conclusion that I should buy it. I can't really say anything wrong about it, it just contains some extra functionality that I do not use (boards, timelines...) and it's not free for private use. But that's how it is, good things are not for free, and it's not that expensive either. Even my colleagues at work using just the CLI were saying how awesome GitKraken looks. I believe these days in a large team there's no need to use simple git CLI when we've got such handy tools available.
