Concentration game **Pexeso**, for one or more players.

[Online](http://pexeso.alestrunda.cz/)

HTML5 game, my old jQuery project. Couple of years ago it was published on Codecanyon for purchase, though it wasn't very successfull, just few sales. Anyway I think it has its uses, as entertainment game or as game for some prizes - for example in eshop, play the game with images of our products and win free delivery.

The game is not available for purchase on Codecanyon anymore - better, it's public, available for free under MIT licence, you can get it from my [GitHub](https://github.com/alestrunda/pexeso), there is also documentation included.
