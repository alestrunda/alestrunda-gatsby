At the moment of writing this post, I have finished 5 IT-related courses on Udemy and a couple more on non-IT topics. Honestly, I'm very grateful for having all this high-quality knowledge at my disposal. For me, as a software engineer, it's very important to keep my knowledge up to date and keep learning new things to be more efficient and skilled. And I think Udemy is a great source for that.

There are many platforms offering online courses, I'm not familiar with all pricing options, but at least on Udemy, there are regular sales. Even a couple of sales during a single month, when we can get courses for pretty low prices - something around €15, which seems like a pretty fair price given courses easily have 40+ hours. I'm comfortable paying that for a high-quality course. Also, I'm able to get to some courses for free as part of my job perks. In case someone is not willing to pay these prices, you can always find decent content for free for example on youtube, but you might need to spend some time browsing the courses to get some that meet your quality expectations. Also on youtube, it might be difficult to get comprehensive courses on a single topic you're interested in.

Thanks to all the authors we have these high-quality courses so easily accessible for anybody. Keep bringing the good stuff and I'll keep watching. And we, software engineers, let's keep pushing our employers to give us free access to these sources. Our employers greatly benefit from our knowledge and we already pay the price by watching the courses in our own free time, while others are watching Netflix. So from my perspective, it sure makes sense to have all related expenses reimbursed.
