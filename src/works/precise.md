My first template on Themeforest, you can find details on the Themeforest page. Quality requirements on Themeforest are really high, just some average theme won't be approved. Hence for the beginning I chose simple HTML template for web under construction. My template was approved so from my first idea "I just give it a try" wound up a business opportunity.

Template has more than 400 sales, anyway later I decided not to sell on Themeforest anymore. The main reason was that the sales are completely unpredictable. You can work on a template for months and yet you've got no quarantee of earning a single dollar.

Don't get the impression that you should try Themeforest as well. There is a huge amount of templates that are rejected because they lack quality or are just marked as not enought interesting for potencial custommers. I saw many authors trying to find out why their templates had not been accepted. Templates that took a lot of time to create but are quite useless after all.
