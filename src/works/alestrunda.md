My presonal web sites. Originally as static web sites, no CMS and using Bootstrap. Then I connected it to WordPress and used my own front-end framework instead of Bootstrap and I also refactored CSS to comply with ITCSS. Now instead of WordPress I switched to static CMS Gatsby.

That's the technological development since 2014.

Design bought on [Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/item/arthenon-creative-one-page-psd-template/7279067).
