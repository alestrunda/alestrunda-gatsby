Educational app for learning english dictionary. Consists of three parts - web app (react), mobile app (react native, Android only) and server part (node.js, mongoDB, REST API).

Made for my bachelor's thesis, graded A so I suppose it was quite fine.

You can use it to, it's available as native app for mobile (Android only) and web app in web browser.
