HTML template for web sites. Especially for photographs as portfolio.

Template is available in two versions: black, white.

I did whole frontend, simple back-end for contact form for newsletter (connected to MailChimp). Design was provided by my partner jThemes.

jThemes is an _Elite Author_ (Elite Author = on Themeforest has sold more than $75000). He has sold more than 5000 items in value more than $125000 (about 3 millions CZK). Of course it's a group of authors, now I'm part of that too.</p>
