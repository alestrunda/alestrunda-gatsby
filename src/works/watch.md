Simple template for web sites under construction. This time I made the whole project on my own including design.

I planned to sell it on Themeforest as my template Precise, that was quite successfull. But this one was not approved, I suppose because of poor design, I should have left the design to professional. Lesson learned: don't try to do everything by yourself, specialize on one thing only.
