Simple template for restaurants built on Next.js

I created the template to experiment with new technologies - Tailwind for styling and Next.js, which is a React framework for complete web applications. Especially I wanted to try Tailwind. I have worked with frameworks like Bootstrap, preprocessors like SASS, methodologies like BEM, etc. Since Tailwind looks pretty popular, I wanted to try if it's something handy I could start using.

Conclusion: it has some pros and cons as everything, but in general it looks very useful. Since I do not have a lot of experience with it, I do not think I would choose it for my next project. But I would certainly be willing to use it if that was the preference of others.
