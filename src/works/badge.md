I don't do design, but you have to try more things before you decide what you want to do, so gave it a try. I think it's not bad, yet I fancy programming more.

Made in Adobe Illustrator, in vectors, so it's easy to change size, color etc.

<p>My own projekt, in case anyone is interested, it's available for purchase - contact me.</p>
