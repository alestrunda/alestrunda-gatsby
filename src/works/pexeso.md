Concentration Game Pexeso, build with jQuery. Made as my personal project to demonstrate me jQuery skills. I did not want to leave it useless hence I published in on Codecanyon so anyone can buy it, though I did not have many purchases. Now after several years it's not for sale anymore, but it's available for free under terms on MIT license - see the github repo for the souce code.

Available on [Codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/concentration-game-pexeso/8489414)
