# Alestrunda web sites

My personal web sites to present myself as a front-end developer.

First version only static, then WordPress, now super fast on Gatsby.

Bootstrapped with [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

Design bought on [https://themeforest.net/item/arthenon-creative-one-page-psd-template/7279067](Themeforest)

Running on Gatsby

Live: http://alestrunda.eu

Hosted on netlify under custom domain

## Scripts

`yarn develop` starts local development server

`yarn build` builds the site into *public* folder
