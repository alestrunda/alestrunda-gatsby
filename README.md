# AlesTrunda Web

My personal web sites to present myself as a front-end developer. Running on Gatsby.

[alestrunda.eu](http://alestrunda.eu) - hosted on netlify uusing private domain.

## History

The first version was only static HTML files, which wasn't very convinient when I wanted the add a post, etc. So I moved to WordPress, which was not very fast, required paid hosting, might include vulnerabilities, etc. Now I'm using super fast static site generator Gatsby and Netlify to host my website free of charge.

Design from [https://themeforest.net/item/arthenon-creative-one-page-psd-template/7279067](Themeforest)

## Scripts

Bootstrapped with [Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

`yarn develop` starts local development server

`yarn build` builds the site into *public* folder
